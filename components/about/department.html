        <h2>About Our Department</h2>
        <p>
          The Department of English at St. Joseph's College, Shift II, was
          established to address the growing demand for expertise in English
          language and literature. The department began with the launch of the
          B.A. English program in 2007 and the M.A. English program in 2011.
          Today, it is one of the largest departments in the management section,
          with over 400 students and 18 dedicated Assistant Professors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Committed to quality education, the department regularly updates its
          syllabus to align with academic and industry trends. Courses are
          designed to enhance students' linguistic and literary skills while
          equipping them with socially relevant, job-oriented knowledge. This
          approach has earned the department a reputation for producing
          career-ready graduates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond academics, the department encourages students to develop
          critical thinking, cultural awareness, and ethical values. Through
          events like Drama-fest, seminars, workshops, and coaching classes for
          NET/SLET, the department fosters intellectual curiosity and
          creativity, shaping the next generation of thinkers, writers, and
          leaders in English studies.
