        <h2>About Our Magazine</h2>
        <p>
          A unique fusion of “English” and “Magazine,” stands as a vibrant
          testament to the voices, creativity and spirit of Gen Z. Its bold “GZ”
          isn’t just a stylistic choice but a declaration of its focus: a
          platform for the new generation to explore, express, and inspire.
          Published biannually as an e magazine by the Department of English
          (Shift II), St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous), Trichy – 02. ENGZINE
          was created with a clear purpose—to nurture and showcase the literary
          and artistic talents blossoming within the student community.

          This magazine isn’t just a collection of works; it’s a community. A
          space where mainly students can develop their craft as editors,
          proofreaders, and creators, fostering a network of emerging writers
