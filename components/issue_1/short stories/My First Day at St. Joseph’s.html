      <h1>My First Day at St. Joseph’s</h1>
    </section>
    <main>
      <p>
        It was around 8 a.m. on July 24th, and I was having breakfast with my
        family. Everyone seemed calm, happily enjoying their dosas, but I was
        filled with nervous energy. Today was my first day of college, and my
        thoughts were racing. Out of nowhere, one of my seniors reminded me,
        “Jefrin, you need to be at college by 8:30 a.m. Don’t be late on your
        first day!” I quickly finished my breakfast, rushed to my room, and put
        on my favourite green shirt and black pants—clothes I had carefully
        picked out the night before. I packed my new notebook, a pen, and a
        water bottle into my bag, took a quick look in the mirror, and smiled.
        “You look good,” I told myself. “Have a nice day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        St. Joseph’s College was only 10 minutes away, but as I hurried towards
        it, my mind was swirling with thoughts. I had heard so much about this
        college—its rich 182-year history, its reputation for academic
        excellence, and the fact that Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had once been a
        student here. I was both excited and nervous about what was ahead. Would
        I fit in? Would I be able to keep up with my studies?
      </p>

      <p>
        On my way, I passed by Our Lady of Lourdes Church. Its beauty always
        struck me, and for a brief moment, I felt a sense of calm wash over me.
        I wanted to stop and say a quick prayer, but time was running out, and I
        couldn’t afford to be late. I hurried on.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I reached the gates of the college, an older man with a white beard
        approached me. I assumed he was a watchman, but as we spoke, I
        discovered he was a Sanskrit teacher. He smiled at me and asked, “Are
        you a first-year student?” I nodded nervously, and he kindly pointed me
        in the direction of KP Joseph’s Hall, where the orientation was being
        held. “Don't be late," he said with a grin.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I entered the college, and the campus buzzed with energy. Students were
        everywhere, some looking as lost as I felt, while others seemed
        confident and in their element. I managed to find my way to the hall,
        where other first-year students were gathering. I quickly found a seat
        and sat down, trying to calm my nerves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room fell silent as a tall man walked onto the stage. He introduced
        himself as Professor Love Joy, the Dean of Students, and welcomed us
        with a warm smile. His voice was calming as he spoke about the college’s
        history, its traditions, and the exciting journey ahead for all of us.
        He reminded us that college was not just about academics but about
        discovering ourselves. His words reassured me. Maybe this was the right
        place for me after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the speech, we were taken on a tour of the campus. As we walked
        through the grounds, I couldn’t help but admire the beauty around me.
        The old, majestic buildings stood tall, the green lawns were perfectly
        maintained, and the students around us seemed to be enjoying every bit
        of their college life. I was both excited and nervous. This would be my
        home for the next several years.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the tour, I met another first-year student, John. And to my
        surprise, we quickly bonded. We chatted, laughed, and by the end of the
        day, it felt like we had known each other for a long time. I was
        relieved to find that I wasn’t the only one feeling anxious, and making
        new friends made the experience even better.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time I returned to my room, I was fatigued yet thrilled. My first
        day at St. Joseph’s College had been an emotional rollercoaster filled
        with nervousness, excitement, and a sense of discovery. I realized that
        today wasn’t just about learning about the college but also about
        learning more about myself. I could see that the next few years were
        going to be full of growth and new experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I lay in bed, reflecting on the day, my worries about fitting in and
        doing well in my studies seemed much smaller than they had in the
        morning. Just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard a knock at the
        door. Confused, I opened it. My companion gave me an envelope, telling
        me that one of my friends came in and gave it to him. I opened it. It
        read like this: "Sometimes the most important lessons are not taught in
        the classrooms alone, but by a good friend that we have. By your new
        friend." Yes, I found it. It was written by my new friend John. I was so
        happy after reading that. I had no idea why he had sent it, but the
        message left me with a sense of calm. Everything was going to be okay.
        With new friends, inspiring teachers, and endless possibilities ahead, I
        fell asleep feeling excited for the adventures yet to come.
