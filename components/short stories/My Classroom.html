        My Classroom - Cherishing every second of my astonishing college life
      </h1>
    </section>
    <main>
      <p>
        Being a literature student, I believe that the classroom evokes a
        variety of emotions in every student’s life. For me, my classroom holds
        a special significance. It seems to have been designed with a French
        architectural influence, characterized by its tall walls and elongated
        pillars. However, the benches are not properly arranged, which adds a
        quirky charm to its ambiance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dynamic of our class is unique. Some students are perpetually late
        and habitually request attendance. Despite this, I find myself enjoying
        the company of our department's staff members. Each professor has a
        distinctive style of teaching. For instance, our General English
        professor always keeps the class engaged. My friends and I often snack
        during class. By some stroke of luck, I’ve managed not to get caught,
        though my friends weren’t as fortunate—they were frequently punished,
        which we all found hilarious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Missing class materials and notes is a recurring issue for us, and it
        has a significant impact on our studies. Occasionally, professors mark
        students absent or even ask them to buy chocolates for everyone as a
        light-hearted penalty. Activities like taking seminars, reading tests,
        and speaking tests are particularly challenging for our class. Most
        students tend to skip these tests, except for two or three who always
        manage to participate. Professors often call on students randomly,
        leading to amusing moments when unprepared students stammer their way
        through impromptu answers, much to the amusement of the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every class has its top performers, and ours is no different. There’s
        one student who always excels but often acts in ways designed to gain
        the teachers’ attention. While this can be annoying at times, it also
        provides moments of comic relief. One of the highlights of our classroom
        experience is a Tamil professor who teaches with a storytelling
        approach, especially when discussing poetry. His narratives are so
        engaging that we often ask him to continue in the next class, and he
        readily obliges, making the sessions even more enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know about others, but I truly adore my classroom—it feels like
        a soulmate. I cherish sitting at my desk and soaking in the lessons, and
        I find joy in simply being in that space. My classroom is more than just
        a place for learning; it’s a sanctuary that holds countless memories and
        experiences.
