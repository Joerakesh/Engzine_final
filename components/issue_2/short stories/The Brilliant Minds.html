      <h1>The Brilliant Minds!</h1>
    </section>
    <main>
      <p>
        In 2524, the University of Edinburgh arranges a meeting to celebrate the
        great victory of the team "BRILLIANT MINDS!" The University's chairman,
        Bernardo John, awarded the team for introducing a serum that cures brain
        diseases.
      </p>

      <p>
        "THE BRILLIANT MINDS!"—Victor Lorenzo, a brilliant science student at
        the University of Edinburgh, along with Alden Carter, a chemistry
        student, and Robert Aaron, a psychology student, formed the team.
        Elizabeth Violet, a literature gold medalist, was the most beautiful
        girl at the university. They arranged a party to celebrate their
        glorious victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the party, Victor, a young, handsome man in a suit and spectacles,
        shared the great achievement with his friends. Everyone congratulated
        the team and enjoyed the evening. In the middle of the party, Victor
        knelt before Elizabeth Violet.
        <em
          >"Elizaa! You are the melody that brings harmony to my life. You're
          the key that fits perfectly into the lock of my heart. Will you marry
          me and make me the happiest man alive?"</em
        >
        She nodded and accepted his proposal with all her heart. The couple
        danced, and the night was filled with celebration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next day, in the Brilliant Minds laboratory, Victor and his friends
        aimed for another breakthrough—immortal life. Alden mixed chemicals and
        created a serum. Robert placed a dead dog on the experimental bed.
        Victor connected a ventilator tube while Eliza pulled the electric
        lever. Victor injected the serum into the dog's brain, increasing the
        dose as Eliza monitored its pulse. The dog showed no signs of life,
        leaving Victor in despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Alden was about to dispose of the body, he noticed slight
        movement. Suddenly, the dog stood up—its eyes black, murmuring something
        eerie. The serum had worked! They rejoiced, unaware of the horror they
        had unleashed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, a power outage plunged the lab into darkness. In the
        confusion, Eliza accidentally hit a high-voltage lever. She screamed as
        electricity coursed through her body. When the lights returned, her
        lifeless form lay on the floor. Victor, devastated, refused to accept
        her death. His friends convinced him to wait, but he was determined to
        bring her back.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trio began the human resurrection process. Eliza’s body was packed
        in an ice box, injected with heparin, and cooled to -130°C. Finally, she
        was placed in a liquid nitrogen-filled tank at -196°C. Alden named their
        new serum the "Lazarus Serum." Victor prepared her for revival,
        injecting the serum into her brain. Minutes passed—then, her body rose
        from the bed.
        <em>"Victor! Am I dead now?"</em> she asked. Alden explained her
        memories remained intact due to the oxygen supply. Victor hugged her,
        but something felt wrong—her eyes were pitch black.
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, Victor prepared dinner, but unsettling events surrounded
        Eliza. He ignored them until, in the dead of night, he awoke to find her
        missing. Following strange murmurs to the basement, he found her
        devouring a decayed rat with the dog. Her reflection in the mirror
        revealed a monstrous creature with horns, four legs, and a grotesque
        tongue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Realizing she was no longer Elizabeth, he called his friends. They
        decided to end the nightmare. Alden attempted to sedate the dog, but it
        bit him. As his eyes turned black, Eliza injected him with the Lazarus
        Serum. Within moments, he too became possessed. The evil inside him
        feigned friendship before biting Victor and Robert. One by one, they
        transformed.
      </p>

      <p>And thus, the evil journey began…</p>
